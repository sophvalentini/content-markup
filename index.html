<h1>Editing Soft Copy</h1>

<p>Editing an electronic file and allowing the author to see the changes is called <i>redlining</i> (also referred to as “editing online”). Basic housekeeping includes removing all double spaces and converting hatches (a.k.a. "dumb quotes") to quotation marks and apostrophes (a.k.a. "smart quotes").
  The editor need not point out these changes to the author.</p>

<p style="text-indent:20px"> Changes to the structure and wording of the text must be communicated to the author.
 A visual convention is needed for showing <s>deleted</s> and <ins>added</ins> material.
 <s>Words to be removed</s> are typically struck out, and words <ins>added or substituted</ins> can be <span class="underline">underlined</span>, <mark>highlighted</mark> or <ins>rendered in color.</ins>
 A line in the margin indicates that a change has been recommended. <ins>[Queries to the author are set off with brackets.]</ins> <sup>A</sup>
</p>

<p style="text-indent:20px"> Underlining<u>, </u>or striking out; punctuation is visually confusing, so the editor often strikes out an entire word<s>, or phrase,</s> <ins>—or phrase—</ins>and types in the freshly punctuated passage as an addition.
 To hyphenate a word such as <em><s>secondrate</s> <ins>second-rate</ins></em>, strike it out and add the hyphenated form.
 When converting hyphens to en dashes (1914-18)—or changing double hyphens to em dashes—the editor simply keys them in.
 Typographic styles such as <span class="italic">italic</span>, <b>boldface</b>, and <span class="small-caps"> small capitals</span> can also be changed directly.
</p>

<p>"The editor must scrupulously remove all traces of the editing process before releasing the file for design and typesetting.
Potential disasters include words that are stucktogether, a missing , or a forgotten comment to the author <ins>[Are you out of your mother-loving mind?].</ins>

  A. Queries to the author can also take the form of footnotes. Identify these notes with letters, so they are not confused with footnotes that belong to the text.</p>
